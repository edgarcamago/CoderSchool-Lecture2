    characters (char)
5) objects

## How do we declare variables?
1) let 
2) var
3) const

## What is the difference between var, let, and const?
### var
- globally scoped or function/locally scoped, 
- var variables can be re-declared and updated
- Hoisting of var (moved to top of scope)
- big weakness: variables easy to be redefined
### let
- let is block scoped
- let can be updated but not re-declared.
### const
- const is block scoped
- cannot be updated or re-declared

## How should we name variables?
Common sense - variables should be named according to what they represent
